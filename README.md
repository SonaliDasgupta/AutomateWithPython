# AutomateWithPython
Code to automate a few tasks with Python, saving manual effort with python scripts.

Tasks covered:
1. Copy folders recursively, and files from one location to another on your computer.
2. Delete old files from a folder

Scripts:
1. replaceDirs.py : Usage:
When two installations of a software are present, and you need to replace older packages or Release Units (RUs) from the earlier installation of a product with the newer RUs, use this script with two text files (old_RUs and new_RUs) containing the package names to replace in new_RU.txt and older package names to delete in old_RUs.txt. 

Useful in case of software products using TPCLs (Third Party Class Libraries) of different versions.
